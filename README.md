# AI:DAO Project, UvA, June 2016

This is a project by Andi Aliko, Kai LÃ¸nning, Lena Herstix and Konstantinos Lampridis


Project includes:
  - Root: Spawner.sol | contract.sol
  - Deployment_scripts:
  - Oracle:

Spawner.sol contains our updated/changed contracts version (edited by Andi as of 20 June)

Contract.sol contains our previous WIP contracts

Inside the deployment_scripts folder, you can find various scripts that were used to deploy different parts of the contract.sol.
spawner.sol, should use the deploySpawner.js script only. Rest should be done automatically.

The oracle folder contains the node.js front end and the python AI scripts.

### Todos

 - Write Tests (use mist) for spawner.sol
 - if spawner.sol doesn't work, solve contract.sol
 - integrate working contracts version with oracle
